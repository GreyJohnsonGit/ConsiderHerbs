Acai products have become popular in the United States, where they have been marketed for weight-loss and anti-aging purposes. The Federal Trade Commission has taken action against companies that marketed acai weight loss products in allegedly deceptive ways. Acai fruit pulp has been used experimentally as an oral contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Acai products are available as juices, powders, tablets, and capsules.",

Researchers who investigated the safety profile of an acai-fortified juice in rats observed that there were no body weight changes in animals given the juice compared with animals that didn��_t receive it. A preliminary study suggested that eating acai fruit pulp might reduce blood sugar and cholesterol levels in overweight people. Laboratory studies have focused on acai��_s potential antioxidant properties, and a juice blend with acai as the main ingredient has been shown to have an antioxidant effect in people.

But the companies decided the cost of conducting safety and effectiveness studies would likely be more than the profit they could expect from sales of cascara. So they didn��_t comply with the request. As a result, the FDA notified manufacturers to remove or reformulate all OTC laxative products containing cascara from the U.S. market by November 5, 2002. Today, you can buy cascara as a \"dietary supplement,\" but not as a drug. \"Dietary supplements\" don��_t have to meet the standards that the FDA applies to OTC or prescription drugs.
